about_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
  I am an AI Engineer at the PoscoDX, specialized at deploying 2D/3D vision models over multiple vision inputs, such as CCTV cameras or LiDARs. I have performed R&D for accelerating AI models in perspective of GPU usage optimization and computer science. I am also involved in deploying Edge-AI with NPUs.

          This is probably one of the greatest apps ever created, if you don't agree you're probably wrong.

          I started this project as a way if learning <mark>React</mark> and it has since grown into a fully fledged app. I have learned many skills through this and been I'm very proud of having this in my portfolio. If you don't have a project as awesome as this I would advise you make one.

            "Focusing on AI deployment to optimize AI hardware and reduce business cost"
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            Currently, I am an Senior AI Engineer for Vision AI. I am specialized to architect real-time vision application with multiple cameras and multiple AI models through maximizing GPU's CUDA/Tensor Core usage and managing CPU core usage with help of TensorRT and Triton Inference Server. I am not only handling 2D models with 2D cameras, but also 3D models such as Depth Estimation using LiDARs. 
            
            Also, I am researching about NPU inference runtime and compilation to deploy AI model in the real world application. After analyzing an ONNX format model, I compile and deploy the AI model for NPU device. I am also performing benchmark test for performance of NPU and its GPU-benchmark.
            
            As many vision AI models are being deployed over Posco factories for many industrial reasons, my role is very important since it can reduce the cost of business, increasing company's net profit.

            "Lots of ML researches for cyber security industry lead me to AI world, which made me to focus utilize AI as an automation tool."
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I re-joined Ahnlab in 2016 as an AI researcher and performed many ML and AI researches to apply automation on SOC operation. Especially, I applied the idea of pre-training and fine-tuning concept on security log domain and developed a BERT model for security domain which was trained from scratch. The pre-trained BERT model for security domain was fine-tuned to be able to correctly classify pre-defined threats.
            
            In SOC, my classification model for pre-defined threats could automate partial regular security analysis, which could reduce human resource for regular jobs.

            I joined Ahnlab in 2012 as a junior security analyst in 2012. I performed as a operator at Security Operation Centre, i.e. SOC. I analyzed real-time incoming network security logs from FW, WAF and IPS to protect customer's server assets until 2015.

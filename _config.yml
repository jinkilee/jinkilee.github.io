  Senior AI Engineer specializing in low-latency, high-throughput inference systems
  with GPU and NPU optimization for production environments.
  
  Performance-oriented AI engineer specializing in low-latency, high-throughput inference systems across GPU and NPU accelerators in real-world production environments.
  
  I design and optimize end-to-end inference pipelines by identifying system-level bottlenecks across preprocessing, model execution, and postprocessing. My work focuses on async execution, accelerator-aware pipeline design, and low-level optimization to deliver measurable latency reduction and cost efficiency.
  
  I have deployed real-time inference systems in safety-critical and resource-constrained environments, achieving **over 50% infrastructure cost savings** through heterogeneous GPU/NPU strategies.

          GPU/NPU Runtime Optimization
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I developed a real-time safety monitoring inference system operating under tight latency constraints and hardware limitations. The solution leveraged asynchronous inference pipelines designed for heterogeneous GPU and NPU execution, allowing flexible deployment across edge environments. Performance was further optimized through TensorRT asynchronous execution and kernel fusion, GPU-resident postprocessing via custom TensorRT plugins, and mixed CPU/GPU preprocessing using NVIDIA DALI to minimize data transfer and synchronization overhead. This architecture enabled stable real-time inference, substantially reduced latency, and resulted in more than 50% savings in hardware infrastructure costs.

          GPU Optimization using graph level kernel fusion
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          I optimized a high-throughput vision inference pipeline that suffered from CPU-bound preprocessing and postprocessing bottlenecks. The pipeline was rearchitected to maintain GPU residency of data across preprocessing, inference, and postprocessing stages, reducing synchronization overhead and host-device transfers. Performance-critical components were reimplemented in C++ and seamlessly integrated into the Python-based inference workflow, while unnecessary CPU–GPU synchronization points were removed. As a result, the system achieved a notable improvement in throughput and more stable P99 latency in real-time inference scenarios.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            As a Senior AI Engineer at POSCO DX, I designed and optimized real-time AI inference pipelines for industrial safety and monitoring systems operating under strict latency and reliability requirements. I reduced end-to-end latency by restructuring asynchronous CPU–GPU execution flows and eliminating synchronization bottlenecks, while improving GPU utilization through TensorRT kernel fusion and execution graph optimization. Performance-critical postprocessing was fully offloaded to the GPU via custom TensorRT plugins, and mixed CPU/GPU preprocessing pipelines were implemented using NVIDIA DALI to overlap I/O and computation. I also integrated NPU-based inference by modifying ONNX graphs and adapting execution pipelines to accelerator-specific constraints. These systems were deployed across domestic industrial sites, overseas subsidiaries, and airport environments, resulting in stable real-time operation and more than 50% reduction in hardware infrastructure costs through heterogeneous accelerator strategies.

        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            I re-joined Ahnlab in 2016 as an AI researcher and performed many ML and AI researches to apply automation on SOC operation. Especially, I applied the idea of pre-training and fine-tuning concept on security log domain and developed a BERT model for security domain which was trained from scratch. The pre-trained BERT model for security domain was fine-tuned to be able to correctly classify pre-defined threats.
            
            In SOC, my classification model for pre-defined threats could automate partial regular security analysis, which could reduce human resource for regular jobs.

            I joined Ahnlab in 2012 as a junior security analyst in 2012. I performed as a operator at Security Operation Centre, i.e. SOC. I analyzed real-time incoming network security logs from FW, WAF and IPS to protect customer's server assets until 2015.

        description: |
          I authored Hello, Transformer, a technical book written prior to the widespread adoption of large language models, aimed at introducing transformer architectures from first principles. The book focuses on core architectural concepts, implementation details, and practical code examples, enabling readers to build a strong foundational understanding of transformer-based models. Throughout the writing process, I continuously refined the content by validating concepts through hands-on experiments and maintaining accompanying code examples, strengthening both my technical depth and ability to communicate complex systems clearly.
